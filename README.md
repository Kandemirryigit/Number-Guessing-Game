Final project looks like this.In this project I used print("\n") commands a lot because I wanted to create a fresh terminal screen.

the main idea of the game: The computer chose a integer number between 1-100 and you are trying to find that number.There are two mode: one of them is easy and another one is hard mode.In easy mode you have 10 attempts.In hard mode you have 5 attempts.If you find the number correctly you win.If you dont have any lives and you still dont know the number you loose.If you want you can restart the game.
